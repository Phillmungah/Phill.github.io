<p>Object oriented Programming makes program more flexible</p>

<p>In the OOP code you determine an object and then list all of the functions it needs to perform OOP creates a new object that keeps all of the function it needs to perform</p>

<p>OOP doesnt need to touch the working code but it types in a new function thats gives all capabilities</p>

<p>OOP is alot neater and organised because if you want to add a new capability you just create a new function without touching any of the old code</p>

<p>OOP requires less code to get things done because of a concept called INHERITANCE.In Inheritance the object is refered to as the super class</p>

<p>Each object has all variables in instance variable oop each object will recieve function called method oop</p>
