###Object oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic. Historically, a program has been viewed as a logical procedure that takes input data, processes it, and produces output data.

It makes programming more flexible

In the OOP code you determine an object and then list all of the functions it needs to perform
OOP creates a new object that keeps all of the function it needs to.

OOP is alot neater and organised because if you want to add a new capability you just create a new function without touching any of the old code

OOP requires less code to get things done because of a concept called INHERITANCE.In Inheritance the object is refered to as the super class

Each object has all variables in instance variable oop each object will recieve function called method oop
