title:OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
---
###Object oriented Programming
It makes programming more flexible

In the OOP code you determine an object and then list all of the functions it needs to perform
OOP creates a new object that keeps all of the function it needs to perform

OOP doesnot need to touch the working code but it types in a new function thats gives all capabilities

OOP is alot neater and organised because if you want to add a new capability you just create a new function without touching any of the old code

OOP requires less code to get things done because of a concept called INHERITANCE.In Inheritance the object is refered to as the super class

Each object has all variables in instance variable oop each object will recieve function called method oop
